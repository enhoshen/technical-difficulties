## paste without messing with vim mapping

- directly type command in command palette: `Ctrl-Shift-P` -> `paste` -> `enter`
- enable system clipboard: `Ctrl-,` -> `search for vim.useSystemClipboard`
  doesn't work for me, when I copy an image and try to paste in directly in a
  markdown file with vscode image pasting support.

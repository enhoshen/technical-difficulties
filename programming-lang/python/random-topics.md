## The self argument of bound method called by other objects

Let's see the following code:

```python
class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.a = 12

    def action(self):
        self.a = 34


>>> a = A()
>>> a.a
12
>>> b = A()
>>> b.action = a.action
>>> b.action()
>>> b.a
12
>>> a.a
34
```

We know the first argument of a method is the `self` object, it might be intuitive to think that when calling `b.action()`, the `self` object would be `b`.

This behavior is called `bound method`, where a method is assoiciated with the instance of the class in which they are defined. How is it done? We need to look at the special attribute `__self__`.

> When an instance method object is created by retrieving a user-defined function object from a class via one of its instances, its **self** attribute is the instance

So for a bound method, the `self` object is not whatever object calling it, but the object recorded in the special attribute `__self__`.

```python
>>> id(b)
140135618006848
>>> id(a)
140135618010064
>>> id(b.action.__self__)
140135618010064
```

Overall, I wouldn't recommand doing such questionable attribute manipulation, it may applies to attribute overide in general.
